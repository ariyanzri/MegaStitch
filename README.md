# MegaStitch: Robust Large Scale Image Stitching

MegaStitch is a novel method for stitchig high resolution image in large scale while being robust to drift and inconsistencies. It was developed for the Phytooracle team to geo-correct and stitch their high resolution large scale imagesets. You can find the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ariyan-Zarei/publication/354153722_MegaStitch_Robust_Large_Scale_Image_Stitching/links/612803a70360302a005f3d62/MegaStitch-Robust-Large-Scale-Image-Stitching.pdf). This repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce our results.
